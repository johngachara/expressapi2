This is a simple express js api that uses a  schema of {full_name : {type:String},
    email_address : {type:String},
    national_id : {type:Number},
    year_of_birth : {type:Number},
    gender : {type:String},
    location : {type:String}}.It is a restful api and hence perfoms all crud operations using mongodb's find functions to handle the operations.It also contains basic error handling
